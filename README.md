# mental-health-chatbot
## Abstract
The project aims to develop and evaluate a conversational chatbot designed to provide mental health support for young adults. The chatbot was developed using neural network and advanced NLP techniques. The model is engineered to process queries in natural language and respond to users with the aim of offering mental health advice and emotional support. The architecture of the model is based on three-layer feedforward neural network with ReLU activation features, with the ability to classify user queries into predefined categories.
The model is trained and validated on a comprehensive dataset consisting of preprocessed publicly available datasets with customization to accurately target young adults. To deploy the trained chatbot model, flask application was used to create an interactive web application. To ensure chatbot’s effectiveneness, training loss and accuracy is measured over the total number of epochs. The evaluation demonstrated a significant reduction in loss over the epochs, indicating effective learning and adaption of the model. To evaluate the web application blackbox test cases were generated to ensure usability of chatbot’s interface. 
Future enhancements for chatbot could include integration of the web application within healthcare systems for improved and personalized support. Additionally chatbot’s scope is expected to expand by implementing interactive features like voice capabilities or multilingual support to cater to diver populations. The implementation of this chatbot signifies a huge step towards the use of AI solutions for providing accessible and effective mental health support.
